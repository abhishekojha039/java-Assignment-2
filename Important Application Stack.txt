Application of stack are

Backtracking​​
Backtracking is a recursive algorithm which is used for solving the optimization problem.
So, In order to find the optimized solution of a problem with Backtracking, we have to find each and every possible solution of the problem, doesn’t matter if it is correct or not.

Function Call​​
In Programming, whenever you make a call from one function to the another function. The address of the calling function gets stored in the Stack.
So, when the called function gets terminated. The program control move back to the calling function with the help of the address which was stored in the Stack.

Parenthesis Checking​​
In Programming, we make use of different type of parenthesis, like – (, ), {, }, which are used for opening and closing a block of code.
So, these parenthesis get stored in Stack and control the flow of our program.

String Reversal​
String Reversal is another amazing Application of Stack. Here, one by one each character of the Stack get inserted into the Stack.
So, the first character of the Stack is on the bottom of the Stack and the last character of the String is on the Top of the Stack.
