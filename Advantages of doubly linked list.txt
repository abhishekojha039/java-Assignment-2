The advantage to a doubly-linked list is that you can traverse the list in two directions (forwards and backwards) while you can only traverse forward using a singly-linked list. This is because when you define a node for a doubly-linked list, you include a pointer to the previous element in the list, as well as a pointer to the next element in the list (in a single-linked list implementation you would only have the next pointer).
It does make insertion and removal of nodes a little trickier, though, as you now have to contend with more pointers to reassign but itâ€™s not too difficult.
