Binary search tree  supports three main operations: searching of elements, insertion of elements, and deletion of elements. Binary Search Tree allows for fast retrieval of elements stored in the tree as each node key is thoroughly compared with the root node, which discards half of the tree.

The major advantage of binary search trees over other data structures is that the related sorting algorithms and search algorithms such as in-order traversal can be very efficient they are also easy to code.
