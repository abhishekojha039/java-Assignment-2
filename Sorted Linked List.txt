Binary search is possible on the linked list if the list is ordered and you know the count of elements in list. But While sorting  the list, you can access a single element at a time through a pointer to that node i.e. either a previous node or next node. This increases the traversal steps per element in linked list just to find the middle element. This makes it slow and inefficient. Whereas the binary search on an array is fast and efficient  because of its ability to access any element in the array in constant time.
