Stack is a linear data structure that can be thought as a basic data structure represented by a collection of items arranged in the form of a physical stack or a pile. Stack is a sequential collection of objects arranged in a particular order so that objects can be inserted and removed from one end only, which is from the top of the stack. An array, on the other hand, is a random access data structure used to store large number of data values to reduce the complexity of the program. In an array, the objects are stored linearly, one after another for efficient memory management.

A stack is a linear data structure which anticipates organization of data in a fixed order, which in this case is LIFO or FILO. The elements can be added and removed from one end only called the top of the stack in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order meaning the recently added object is the first to be removed from the stack or the first one in should be removed last (FILO). An array is a collection of objects which you can access at any time meaning objects can be inserted and removed randomly irrespective of their order.
